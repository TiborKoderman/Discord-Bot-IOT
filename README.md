# Discord bot
This is the discord bot I made for fun


# Functionality:

1. some basic moderation (done from toutorial, so it doesn't matter)

2. Roll dice

3. Interaction with IoT devices, the bot is capable of interacting with discord chat and writing out on a SPI display last three messages posted in any server
where the bot resides in, additionally it is capable of turning on a 60W lightbulb using !on or !off command.

# Installation:

0. Install node.js and npm

1. Clone repository

2. Change token to that of your bot

3. in index.js change mqtt broker to yours

4. run index.js with node

# you can use it as it is by going to:
https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=557299093282619424&permissions=67584&scope=bot

But note, that this one only works on my clients I have at home, Roll dice should still work normaly though.
